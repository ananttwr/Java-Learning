# Java Learning: Lecture Code Examples

Welcome to my **Java learning repository**. This repo contains **hands-on examples** and **exercises** covering various Java concepts that I've learned from my Java tutorials and lectures. It's a personal project where I experiment with different Java features, like object-oriented programming (OOP), data types, loops, and more.

## üöÄ Topics Covered

- Data Types and Keywords
- Type Conversion
- Classes and Objects
- Static Members
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Exception Handling
- And more...
